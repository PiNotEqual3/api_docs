Software Development Kits
=========================

At the moment, official Emarsys SDKs are not available. There are some available open source projects created by third party developers, and we recommend
that you try one these. 

.. note::
We have no control over these libraries and we can't guarantee their quality.

* `PHP HTTP Client for Emarsys Webservice <https://github.com/snowcap/Emarsys>`_
* `Ruby Wrapper for the Emarsys API <https://github.com/Absolventa/emarsys-rb>`_
