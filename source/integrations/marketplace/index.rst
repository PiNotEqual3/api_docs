Marketplace
===========

The marketplace is an upcoming feature where Emarsys customers can install and remove add-ons (i.e. integrations).
The Suite application reports lifecycle events (e.g. installation, removal) to the integration, and it also passes relevant
customer information optionally. Based on these, the integration can set up users or do other administration tasks.

HTTP Interfaces
---------------

In the following pages, we describe the HTTP interface which needs to be implemented for each Marketplace
integration to work.
