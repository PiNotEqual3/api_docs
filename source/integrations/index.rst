Suite Integrations
==================

We are providing several opportunities to integrate with our services. You can integrate with the
Automation Center by creating a custom node that works with contacts, or you can add your
service to the Suite as a menu point and provide an integrated experience for your customers.

   <h2>Authentication</h2>

We are using the open source `Escher <http://escherauth.io/>`_ library to
sign our requests. It is demanded that the endpoints are implemented through the HTTPS protocol.

**Integration Points**:

* *Credential Scope* is service specific (your contact person will share this information)
* *Algo Prefix* and *Vendor Key* are both set to "**EMS**"
* *Date Header Key* is set to "**X-Ems-Date**"
* *Authentication Header Key* is set to "**X-Ems-Auth**"
